;This is the rules file, each line must contain only one rule in this format:
;*url*,*action: Deny|Allow|Redirect*,[Optional RedirectUrl]
;
;*url* can contain '*' characters which means that at '*' positions, there can be any number of other characters.
;When *url* with '*' is in conflict with a *url* without '*', the rule from *url* without '*' has priority.
;When multiple *url* with '*' are conflicting, the first rule with *url* with '*' has priority.
;
;Examples:
;Example.com,Deny
;   This will redirect every Examples.com query to the Localhost address (the default for localhost is "NXDOMAIN" which sends a domain not found error, you can use a custom one from the command line args)
;Example.com,Redirect,Example2.com
;   This will redirect Example.com to Example2.com, you can also use an IP address
;Example.com,Allow
;   This will resolve Example.com to its real address, use this with BlockNotInList set to true, so every other site will be redirected to Localhost
;*Example*,Deny
;Example.com,Allow
;   This will resolve Example.com to its real address and Example.net to the Localhost address
;Example.*,Allow
;*Example*,Deny
;   This will resolve Example.com or Example.net to its real address and test.Example.com to the Localhost address
;*Example*,Deny
;Example.*,Allow
;   This will redirect Example.com, Example.net and test.Example.com to the Localhost address
