    <TIP_SURVEY>Leave feedback in our survey to make your mark on the final design of Sodium2!</TIP_SURVEY>
    <TIP_AIRBRAKES>Remember to use your air brakes by pressing [L1] or [R1] when going into a corner. Air brakes are incredibly effective in giving you extra turning capability.</TIP_AIRBRAKES>
    <TIP_UPGRADE>Upgrading your vehicle can provide you with explosive performance. Visit the Sodium2 shop to acquire enhanced components, then equip them in the garage.</TIP_UPGRADE>

    <TIP_FIRECRACKER_A>Need that extra burst of acceleration? The %s packs an awesome punch to get you out of tight situations.</TIP_FIRECRACKER_A>
    <TIP_HDCSAL_A>Impress your friends with the %s premium paint scheme. This radical HDC design features go-faster everything!</TIP_HDCSAL_A>
    <TIP_FLIGHT_A>Flight computers provide much needed stability to your Sodium Velocity Racer. Just what you need to counteract the destabilising effects of powerful afterburners.</TIP_FLIGHT_A>

    <TIP_FLIGHT_B>In Project Velocity you need nerves of steel, and to be ice cold under pressure. A Flight Computer's onboard AI is the steady hand you need to keep control on the ragged edge.</TIP_FLIGHT_B>
    <TIP_TOUCHSTONE_B>Luck favours the prepared mind in Jet racing. Too much torque and they'll be washing you off the wreckage, too much control and they'll think you never left the garage. %s rocket boosters have the versatility you need.</TIP_TOUCHSTONE_B>
    <TIP_BONESHAKER_B>There is no second place, at 1000 mph an eyeblink is the difference between victory or failure. Need an explosion of speed to beat the other guy to the line? %s afterburners, when break neck is the only speed you need.</TIP_BONESHAKER_B>
    <TIP_AEROBATIC_C>Show that Sodium Velocity Racer who's boss. %s aerofoils help you maintain control on even the tightest of bends.</TIP_AEROBATIC_C>

    <TIP_FLIGHT_C>Afterburners made things a little unstable? Let the flight computer handle it while you concentrate on victory.</TIP_FLIGHT_C>
    <TIP_TOUCHSTONE_C>Don't get left behind! Use %s boosters to get out of tight spots.</TIP_TOUCHSTONE_C>
    <TIP_BONESHAKER_C>Need to shave seconds off your time? %s afterburners will give you that race-winning extra speed.</TIP_BONESHAKER_C>
