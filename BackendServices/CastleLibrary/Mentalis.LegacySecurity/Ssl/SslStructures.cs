		 *    If you require PCT support in your application, simply uncomment the enumeration field below.

		 *    default on Windows Server 2003. Using the PCT protocol on this platform is therefore not
		 *    supported and will result in an exception. The PCT protocol can be turned on again in Windows
		 *    Server 2003 by changing some registry entries, but this is not recommended.
